# Marry Me Chicken 

4 Servings, 1 hour 

## Ingredients
- 3 Large Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts
- 1/3 cup all purpose flour 
- 3 TBSP extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 TBSP butter
- 3 Garlic Cloves, chopped
- 1 TBSP tomato paste
- 1/2 TSP dried Oregano
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 1/2 cup half and half
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan 
- 1/3 cup sliced sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
- Fresh basil for serving

## Seasonings:
- Salt
- Pepper
- Red-pepper flakes to taste

## Instructions: 

Slice each chicken breast in 1/2 horizontally so you end up with a total of 6 cutlets.  Season both sides of the chicken cutlets well with salt and pepper.  

Scatter the flour on a large plate and coat the cutlets, shaking off the excess.  Transfer the cutlets to a sheet pan or large plate. 

Heat the oil in a large pan over medium high.  Once hot, reduce the heat to medium and add the butter.  As soon as it melts, add the cutlets and cook until golden, ~5 minutes.  Flip the chicken and cook the other side until golden (~4-5 minutes).  Do this in batches if needed.  Transfer the cutlets to a plate or sheet pan. 

Reduce the heat to low, add the garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes.  Add the tomato paste, stirring until the color deepens, ~2 minutes.  Add the oregano and red-pepper flakes, to taste.  Increase the heat to medium, add the stock and bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits from the bottom of the pan until the liquid is reduced by half (~5 minutes). 

Add half and half and warm through, stirring, until it thickens slightly (~3 minutes).  Watch the cream closely, reducing the heat if necessary, to maintain a gentle simmer.  Stir in the parmesan and the sun dried tomatoes.  Place the chicken back in the pan to marm through (~4 minutes).  Remove from heat and scatter fresh basil on top.

# Sazon Chicken Breasts

4 Servings, 1 hour 

## Ingredients
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- ¼ cup fresh orange juice, from 2 small oranges (preferably mandarin)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons homemade or store-bought basic sazón seasoning or (substitute the list below)
  - Cumin
  - Salt
  - Garlic
  - Oregano
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 4 medium boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 ½ pounds), trimmed of excess fat

## Instructions: 
- Step 1
In a small food processor, combine the garlic, orange juice, olive oil, sazón, salt and pepper; pulse until it forms a creamy marinade. (Alternately, you can finely mince the garlic, then combine it with the rest of the ingredients in a small bowl, stirring with a fork.)

- Step 2
Pat the chicken breasts dry, then transfer them to a large resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade on top, close, shake, then gently massage the seasoning into the meat. Let sit on the counter for at least 10 minutes. (Chicken can also be marinated overnight then set out to come to room temperature before cooking.)

- Step 3
Heat a large nonstick wok or deep skillet over medium-high. Add marinated chicken breasts, one by one, and pour over about half the marinade. Cook for 7 to 10 minutes, flipping frequently with tongs and being careful not to let them get too dark too fast. Reduce heat to low and cook for another 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the breast, flipping often to ensure meat is cooked through. Thinner chicken breasts will take less time to cook, so monitor the color and texture of your meat as it cooks. Check doneness by pressing the center with your tongs. If the center is still squishy, continue to cook until meat has a bit of resistance (though not rock hard), and registers 165 degrees on a meat thermometer.

- Step 4
Let rest in the pan off-heat for a few minutes. Serve, pouring over any remaining pan juices if desired.
